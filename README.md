# Like-and-retweet-bot-twitter
With this simple code you can will use an AutoBot for your Account Twitter.

The first think that you will to do is go to 'https://developer.twitter.com/' Sign Up and Sign In.

Later you will go to 'Apps' -> 'Create an app' -> and compile the request... don't worry it isn't important so you can insert "BlaBlaBla..."

Create

Whene you have created it you will go to 'Keys and tokens' and you shoud click on Generate (if it doesn't generated).

Open my .py file and change the values with your keys...

Run it and enjoy (:
